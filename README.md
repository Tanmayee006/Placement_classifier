# Placement_classifier
Build a classifier using machine learning algorithms for predicting the placement of student based on his/her exam scores.
<br>
This was our SCE task for AI subject.
<br>
I used 4 algorithms :<br>
1.Logistic regression<br>
2.Support vector machine (SVM)<br>
3.Random forest classifier<br>
4.XGBoost<br>
<br>
<b> These are the accuracies of the model </b><br><br>
Model Accuracy on Test Set using Logistic regression: 82.19%<br>
Model Accuracy on Test Set using SVM: 83.56%<br>
Model Accuracy on Test Set using RandomForestClassifier: 90.41%<br>
Model Accuracy on Test Set using XGBoost: 90.41%<br>
